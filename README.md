# MMTI
MMTI: A Multi-Grade, Multi-Subject Dataset for Teaching Intention Recognition in Real Classrooms  
  
We construct a MMTI dataset for real classroom scenarios, and design a three-dimensional, eight-category teaching intention annotation scheme. To the best of our knowledge, MMTI is the first dataset that supports teaching intention recognition across multiple grade levels and subject domains in real classroom settings.

In future work, we plan to incorporate audio and visual modalities (e.g., speech prosody and classroom video cues) into the dataset to enable more accurate and fine-grained teaching intention recognition.
  
We have provided a portion of the samples for review. The full MMTI dataset will be organized and released in the future.
